Some home-grown stuff on writing a Terraform provider.  

Why write a Terraform provider?
* Understand the inner workings of Terraform and IaC tools in general.
* Another reason to learn Go.
* Write better APIs.
* Might have to write one someday.

Assumptions:
* Using vscode, docker
  * Install the 'Hashicorp Terraform' extension.
* Some coding language, like Python, but zero knowledge of Go.
* Some Linux, Containers and GitHUb Actions knowledge.

Approach
* Top-down - attempt to do someting assuming it exists, if it does not exist, create it.

## Learning Go
Since Terraform providers are written in Go, we need to learn a few things about Go.
